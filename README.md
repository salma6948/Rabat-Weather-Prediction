# 🌤️ Weather Forecasting in Rabat using NeuralProphet

This project aims to **predict hourly temperature in Rabat** using historical weather data and the **NeuralProphet** library — a powerful, flexible time series forecasting tool.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The goal of this project is to **forecast temperature values at each hour** for the city of **Rabat**, Morocco. Using past temperature data, the model is able to generate accurate short-term forecasts.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍 — Core programming language
- **Pandas** — Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy** — Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** — Data visualization
- **NeuralProphet** — Forecasting library used to train the model

---

## 📊 What the Model Does

- Loads historical hourly temperature data
- Cleans and processes it using Pandas
- Trains a **NeuralProphet model** on the data
- Generates **hour-by-hour temperature forecasts**

---

## 📦 Output

- Trained NeuralProphet model
- Hourly temperature predictions
